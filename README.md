# newrelic-cli
New Relic CLI is a command line tool which is used to operate New Relic objects(Synthetic monitors, alert policies, conditions, account users etc). You can use it easily to list/get/create/delete these objects. It can be used to backup your New Relic configuration data and restore in the future. It is easy to be used other than calling different REST API endpoints.
